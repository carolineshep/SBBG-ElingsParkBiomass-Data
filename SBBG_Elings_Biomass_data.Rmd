## Introduction:

This code aims to synthesize and visualize data collected on Biomass (kg/m2) and Mortality of plants in the Elings Park Restoration Project. The Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, in partnership with Channel Islands Restoration, is transforming a 1-acre plot of land previously full of invasive weeds, into a better-functioning native habitat.

In this analysis, we explore the relationship between different weed treatments (sheet mulching and plastic tarping) and plant mortality and growth. 

```{r}
# read in the data

elings_data <- read.csv(here("ElingsMonitoringData.csv")) %>% clean_names()

# group by plot and sum biomass 

biomass_plot <- elings_data %>% 
  group_by(plot_id) %>% 
  summarise(biomass_sum = sum(biomass_kg_m2))

# group by plot and sum mortality

mort_plot <- elings_data %>% 
  group_by(plot_id) %>% 
  summarise(mort_sum = sum(mort_status, na.rm = TRUE))

# group by treatment and sum biomass

biomass_treatment <- elings_data %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(biomass_sum = sum(biomass_kg_m2))

# group by treatment and sum mortality

mort_treatment <- elings_data %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(mort_sum = sum(mort_status, na.rm = TRUE))

```


### Time for some data exploration! Looking at trends in mortality and biomass based on plot and treatment.
```{r}

# explore the data! look at trends!

#graphing biomass by plot

ggplot(data = biomass_plot, aes(x = plot_id, y = biomass_sum)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw()

# graphing biomass by treatment

ggplot(data = biomass_treatment, aes(x = treatment, y = biomass_sum)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw()

# graphing mortality by plot
ggplot(mort_plot, aes(x = plot_id, y = mort_sum)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw()

# graphing mortality by treatment
ggplot(data = mort_treatment, aes(x = treatment, y = mort_sum)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw()


# would like to look at PERCENT plants alive in next analysis
# I also want to look at average biomass per plant per plot
# and average biomass per species per treatment


```
